        What is Mental Health?
      </h3>
      <p>
         Mental health is made up of our psychological and emotional well being. Mental health doesn’t always mean something is wrong with you. Think of it as a ladder. At the highest point you associate emotion like happiness, confidence, joy, and at the lowest point we associate things like depression and sadness. A lot of things can play into your mental health for instance how you were raised and even situations that may have happened throughout your life. As a society we strive for you to be at the top of the ladder because it means you are at your best mentally and can live happier.

         Mental health is just as important because just like any other physical health it can hurt you. If you are not healthy mentally it can become a huge problem. It is important to have good mental health because it affects all aspects of your life and it will help you to be the best person you can be.
